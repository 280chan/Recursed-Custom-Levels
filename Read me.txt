To play custom levels for the puzzle game Recursed, you need to do:

1. Move all the level files into directory below

\Recursed\custom\missions\

2. Restart the game if the game is currently running. The levels are inside Start - Nexus - Custom.



For players not yet finish main game (including two in-game DLCs but not The Ice Palace):
Some of the levels use late-game objects / skills. You'd better finish the main game before playing those levels. Here I will list where you need to reach in main game for better playing experience.
Amphibian - Finish The Oobleck Conundrum DLC, or at least most of them.
Climb - Finish all the main game, or at least unlocked the Invalid achievement in The Last Tapestry DLC.
Disparadox - Finish Dungeon, finishing Ruins would be better.
Gems - Finish all the main game, or at least unlocked the Invalid achievement in The Last Tapestry DLC.
Jam - Finish Temple, finishing The Void would be better.
Paradoxically Practice - Finish Dungeon, finishing The Void would be better.
Raise - Finish The Void.
Tide - Finish The Oobleck Conundrum DLC, or at least most of them.
Transport - Finish The Oobleck Conundrum DLC, or at least most of them.
